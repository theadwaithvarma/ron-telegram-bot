# Changelog

## 1.1.0 — 2026-09-20

Self-sufficiency release: the multi-provider brain, token economy, and
self-healing supervision that landed on the live bot after 1.0.1.

- **Multi-provider AI brain** (`ron_ai.py`) — failover chain Groq
  (`openai/gpt-oss-120b` → `openai/gpt-oss-20b`) → Gemini
  (`gemini-3.8-flash` → `gemini-flash-lite-latest`) → OpenRouter
  (`nex-agi/nex-n2.5-pro:free` → `nvidia/nemotron-3.5-lightning:free`),
  tunable via `ron_ai.json`. Per-provider 429 cooldowns, 401/403 skips the
  rest of that provider, model-not-found skips just that model. Providers
  without a key are skipped silently — the bot runs fine on Groq alone.
  Errors stay provider-neutral; only the owner (if `OWNER_ID` is set) gets
  a private heads-up about a dead key
- **Token economy (Phase 2)** — a failed stream after full chain exhaustion
  goes straight to the honest error instead of re-running the whole chain;
  greetings and small talk try each provider's smallest model first with a
  short prompt; pure acknowledgements (`ok`, `lol`, `thanks`, `👍`, `gn`)
  get canned replies with zero API calls (still logged to history)
- **Watchdog supervisor** (`ron_watchdog.py`, new) — 60-second checks for
  dead/hung daemons (stale heartbeat), duplicate processes, and invalid
  `ron_ai.json`; exponential restart backoff (60s → 5min → 15min → 1h);
  broken configs are quarantined and the last-known-good copy restored.
  Ships with `ron-watchdog.service.example` for systemd
- **Degraded mode** — after 5 systemic AI failures in 10 minutes the bot
  stops burning API calls, tells users honestly their message is queued,
  persists the queue to `degraded_queue.jsonl`, and replays it on recovery
  without duplicates; canned acknowledgements keep working throughout
- **Business / Secretary Mode** — handles `business_connection` and
  `business_message` updates: replies go to the customer through the
  owner's business account as one rich message (no draft streaming there)
- Release packaging: `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` added to
  `config.py` and `.env.example`; `ron_ai.json` ships the default model
  chain; all runtime state files are git-ignored

## 1.0.1 — 2026-09-20

Runtime sync: three batches that landed on the live bot after 1.0.0.

- **Ephemeral group welcomes wired up** — the joiner-only welcome popup
  (`ephemeral_message_parameters`) was defined but never called; it now fires
  for each new human member (bots skipped), with a dedicated message for the
  Muse Playground group and a generic fallback elsewhere
- **12 stability fixes** — stall watchdog no longer tripped by long reasoning
  traces (plus a 600s absolute stream cap), history/state file write races
  fixed (locks + atomic tmp+rename writes), orphaned stream bubble on failure
  fixed, `STOP_EVENTS` clobbering fixed, per-update offset saves, silent
  message loss on bad keyboards fixed (`callback_data` truncated to 64 bytes),
  UTF-16-aware group mention detection, `/cmd@otherbot` ignored, expired
  Playground watch hook removed
- **Native draft streaming** — 1:1 streaming migrated from the
  `sendMessage`/`editMessageText` loop to Telegram's native `sendMessageDraft`
  (Bot API 9.3+): instant "Thinking…" placeholder, throttled draft growth,
  native stop button via `can_stop`/`keep_on_stop` with graceful fallback,
  `stopped_message_generation` handling; the final reply still goes out via
  `sendRichMessage` with full formatting
- Added `TELEGRAM_DOCS_NOTES.md` — distilled notes from the official Telegram
  Bot docs that drove the streaming migration

## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-20

Initial release. Snapshot of the bot running as `@ronrebootedbot`.

- Conversational AI backend on Groq (`openai/gpt-oss-120b`) with per-chat
  rolling history and model fallback on 429 rate limits
- Live token streaming into 1:1 chats via progressive rich drafts
  (Bot API 10.1), with plain-text fallback
- Telegram 10.3 stop-button support (`stopped_message_generation`)
- Native polls: `/poll`, `/pollm` (multi-answer), `/quiz`
- DM-to-group pings via `[send_group: Group | message]` trailers with fuzzy
  group-name resolution and requester mentions
- Forum topic management: `getChat` forum detection (cached), automatic stale
  topic purge, `[topic: ...]` / `[send_topic: ...]` trailers
- Quick-reply inline buttons (`[buttons: ...]`) and contextual links
  (`[links: ...]`) trailers; button taps re-send as user messages
- Ephemeral new-member welcomes (visible only to the joiner)
- Typing indicators, graceful shutdown draining in-flight replies,
  persisted update offset, per-chat history
- Config fully via environment variables (`.env.example`); no hardcoded
  secrets or ids
